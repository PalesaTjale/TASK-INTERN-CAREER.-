Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster & Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification - Machine Learning Exploration
Overview

This repository contains two Notebooks that explore machine learning tasks: predicting survival on the Titanic and classifying breast cancer diagnoses. Below is a combined summary of both projects:
Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster
Introduction

The Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster notebook guides through building machine learning models to predict survival on the Titanic.
Steps Covered:

    Mounting the Drive to the Colab Notebook: Accessing the dataset stored in Google Drive.
    Importing Libraries: Essential libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
    Exploring the Data: Loading the Titanic dataset, exploring its structure, checking for missing values, and visualizing key features.
    Pre-Processing: Handling missing values, dropping irrelevant columns, and one-hot encoding categorical variables.
    Model Building and Evaluation: Splitting data, training Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers, and evaluating model performance.
    Model Tuning: Standardizing features, retraining SVM model, and evaluating the tuned model's performance.
    Conclusion: Final evaluation of the tuned Support Vector Machine model.

For detailed implementation and code execution, refer to the Jupyter Notebook Titanic_Machine_Learning_from_Disaster.ipynb in this repository.
Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification - Machine Learning Exploration
Introduction

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification notebook explores and classifies the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
Goals:

    Explore and understand dataset features.
    Build and evaluate machine learning models for classifying breast cancer diagnoses.

Steps Covered:

    Data Loading and Cleaning: Load dataset, perform basic cleaning, and standardize features using StandardScaler.
    Data Exploration: Analyze data distribution, visualize feature correlations, and explore diagnosis distribution.
    Model Building and Evaluation: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest classifiers. Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning and evaluate model performance.
    Future Considerations: Consider feature importance analysis, class imbalance handling, and trying alternative classification algorithms.

Running the Notebook on Google Colab:

    Upload the Task_2.ipynb notebook to your Colab workspace.
    Change the file path in the df = pd.read_csv(...) line to point to the location of your data file.
    Run the notebook cells.

Dependencies:

This notebook requires various Python libraries including pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
